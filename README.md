This is my second web development project.
I have learned HTML and CSS, and I am currently learning JavaScript.
Using my knowledge, I created this project that looks like a basic Spotify clone.
Features:
HTML for structure
CSS for styling
JavaScript (in progress) for functionality
Responsive design for mobile screens.
Works on both desktops and mobiles.
